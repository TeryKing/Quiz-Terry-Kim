JS Quiz by Terry Kim

Presents the user with a timed quiz using JavaScript functions. 
It is a simple multiple questions with 4 choices. 
User will have a 30 seconds to answer all the questions otherwise the quiz will end and display the users score.

The quiz script will do the follow:

-If the user answers the wrong question, they will lose 5 seconds to their current time and proceeds to the next question.

-If the user answers correctly, then it will move on to the next question.

-This quiz only has 5 questions, thus it is a fairly short quiz, so users should be attempting correctly answer the first time rather than try every single answer before finding the correct answer.

-Once the timer hits 0 or if the quiz ends, then the user has an option to retry the quiz or save their highscore.

-If the user chooses to save their score, they will be directed to another html for high score displays.

-User will put their initials in and press submit, which will display their score and initials.
